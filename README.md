Several minimal implemetations of RL/Imitation algorithms, following CleanRL's philosophy.

The repo aims to provide implementationas that can swiftly modified for prototyping while serves as a baseline for comparison.

Supported algorithms:
- [x] PPO-clip, for continuous action
- [x] TD3
- [ ] SAC
- [ ] Behavioral Clone
- [ ] Implicit Behavior Clone
- [ ] Decision Transformer
