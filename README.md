# clean-isaac-gym
Several minimal implemetations of RL/Imitation algorithms, following CleanRL's philosophy.

The repo aims to provide implementationas that can swiftly modified for prototyping while serves as a baseline for comparison.

Supported algorithms:
- [x] PPO-clip, for continuous action
- [ ] TD3
